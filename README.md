# Overview

McCarthy's Bistro Website was created as Portfolio Project #4 (Full-Stack Toolkit) for Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net).

Project purpose was to build a full-stack site using agile methodology to plan and design web application using MVC framework and related contemporary technologies. Appplication offers users full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality.

This is a project designed and developed to create a complete experience for the clients of McCarthy's Bistro. The clients/guests are given opportunity to create an account, manage their account, create a booking and post a review.

This project is very much a personal one. Having been in the hospitality industry for most of my career and having almost 15 years culinary experience, this website look exactly as how I imagine my dream restaurant located in my hometown would look like.

Application offers such functionalities as:



## Agile Methodology
This project was developed utilising the Agile Methodogy.<br>
This is the first time I used Agile methodology when planning full-stack django website with a focus on delivering the basic app functionalities. I prioritized features by labeling them as "must-have" or "could-have" and moved some less critical ones to future development. To guide my development process, I created user stories for both the admin/staff user and guests/clients/customers. These stories helped to define the features and functionalities that were most important to project's target audience.

As a student solo developer who was learning a lot during development, I faced challenges in estimating the time required for each task and only had a basic concept of what I would create. Therefore, I kept things simple and focused on achievable goals. Aiming for Minimum Viable Product, or MVP.

To keep track of progress,Github Projects. I used a kanban board divided into following sections: "to do", "in progress" "done", "future enhancements" and "bugs" that allowed me to visualize all tasks and prioritize next steps. However, I could not find the "epics" feature in GitHub Projects, only milestones (it provides only [milestones and issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues)). Epics are supposed to be larger in scope than milestones, representing a significant amount of work. Milestones, on the other hand, are meant to mark significant points in time in terms of project completion. In this document, I added epics, but on the project board, I used only [milestones](https://github.com/Aylamccarthy/mccarthys-bistro-restaurant-booking-system/milestones) to stay in order with GitHub's features.

By using agile methodology, I was able to stay organized and focused on delivering the most important features, while also allowing flexibility for future development. This experience gave me valuable insight and lessons that I can apply to future projects.
