# Overview

McCarthy's Bistro Website was created as Portfolio Project #4 (Full-Stack Toolkit) for Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at [Code Institute](https://www.codeinstitute.net).

Project purpose was to build a full-stack site using agile methodology to plan and design web application using MVC framework and related contemporary technologies. Appplication offers users full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality.

This is a project designed and developed to create a complete experience for the clients of McCarthy's Bistro. The clients/guests are given opportunity to create an account, manage their account, create a booking and post a review.

This project is very much a personal one. Having been in the hospitality industry for most of my career and having almost 15 years culinary experience, this website look exactly as how I imagine my dream restaurant located in my hometown would look like.

Application offers such functionalities as:



## Agile Methodology
This project was developed utilising the Agile Methodogy.<br>
This is the first time I used Agile methodology when planning full-stack django website with a focus on delivering the basic app functionalities. I prioritized features by labeling them as "must-have" or "could-have" and moved some less critical ones to future development. To guide my development process, I created user stories for both the admin user and regular visitors. These stories helped to define the features and functionalities that were most important to project's target audience.

As a student solo developer who was learning a lot during development, I faced challenges in estimating the time required for each task and only had a basic concept of what I would create. Therefore, I kept things simple and focused on achievable goals. Aiming for Minimum Viable Product, or MVP.
